    <p class="text">Robert Johnson was a legendary American blues guitarist 
    and singer, considered one of the most influential musicians 
    in the genre's history. Born in 1911 in Mississippi, he had 
    a short life, passing away at the age of 27 in 1938.</p>
    <p class="text">His music was marked by intense lyrics and an exceptional
    guitar-playing skill, especially in the fingerpicking style. 
    Johnson is famous for the legend that he sold his soul to the 
    devil at a crossroads to become a great musician. His 
    recordings, such as Cross Road Blues, Sweet Home Chicago, and 
    Hellhound on My Trail, have influenced generations of artists, 
    including Eric Clapton, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin.</p>
    <p class="text">He died under mysterious circumstances, possibly poisoned, and 
    his exact grave remains unknown. Even with only 29 recorded 
    songs, his impact on blues and rock is immeasurable.</p>
